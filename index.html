                <p>Ed Colbert has spent around two hours painting everyday since retiring in 2017. Colbert paints in his lofted art studio, which was recently built into the house as an addition. Colbert's paintings can be found in almost every room of the house. He has an unusual style of painting that is not often popular among house visitors. </p>

                <p> <br> <br> Edward Colbert, 57, of Midland, MI, has an unusual style of painting that he said is not often well received.</p> <p>His home is covered from wall to wall in his paintings and sketches. There are roughly 45 paintings in the living room, and about 15 more leaning against the wall, waiting to be hung up. </p> <p>Colbert’s art studio is equally as cluttered with his work. There are finished and half-finished paintings on easels, paintings stacked on shelves, and sketches laid across the floor. Every square-inch is filled by his artwork. </p> <p>“I don't particularly want [my paintings] in my house hanging up, but there's nowhere else to put them,” Colbert said.</p> <p>Kelley Colbert, 54, of Midland, MI, has been married to Edward for nearly 33 years. She said that he has been painting as long as she knew him.</p> <p>“It was one of the things that I liked about him,” Kelley said. “He had this unusual hobby that none of the other people that I knew had.”</p> <p>According to Kelley, Edward was painting in the boiler room of the basement when they initially moved into their current home in 1999. She said that his painting space was, “dark and dreary.” </p> <p>Kelley noted that Edward started painting more frequently when the family moved back from Tokyo, where they lived for nearly three years, in 2008. The family built an addition onto their house, giving Edward his own lofted art studio. </p> 
                
                
                <p>Kelley said that she has mixed feelings about his paintings being displayed all around the house. </p> <p> “Sometimes I'd like just a normal home with the usual pictures in it instead of an art gallery, but when we have company over and people are kind of wowed by all of the paintings all over the house, then I look at them differently and decide that I do enjoy having them,” Kelley said.</p> <p>In college, Edward took an art course and was encouraged to pursue painting by his teacher, who told him he had “strong creative emotions,” according to Edward. He went from painting cartoons of Tony the Tiger and Cap’n Crunch to more abstract works of art. </p> <p> Most of Edward’s paintings feature disfigured people, sometimes naked, sometimes missing body parts, rarely based on reality. Edward said that his art consists of stories from his head come to life on a canvas. </p> <p>“Somewhere between cartoon-ish and reality, but certainly not relying on any kind of replication of figures or objects,” Edward said. “It's more about replicating the stories in my head.”</p> <p>Because Edward’s art is so unusual, he said that the majority of his feedback comes in the form of subtle criticism. He noted that people either comment that it is “interesting,” and say nothing more, or just do not comment on the art at all. </p> <p>“I've received many, many pieces of feedback,” Edward said. “Most of it is silence.”</p> <p>According to Edward, he does not particularly seek out feedback on his artwork and does not have plans to sell his artwork ever. He is currently working on an autobiographical sketch book. The book compiles 125 of his paintings and drawings, each with its own mini-story. </p>
